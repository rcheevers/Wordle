fix transpostion table keys so maximum will never return 0
sort guesses before calling miniMax/expectiMin so more can be pruned
sort results for maximum
make sure pruning works for expectiMin (I doubt it does)

store transposition tables in a way that I won't run out of memory and I can store values between sessions.
add possible word list, length for depth, and word for depth to transpostion tables.
